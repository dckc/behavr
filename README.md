# Toward Behavioral Type checking for Rholang

_status: just getting off the ground; not yet functional_

Goals:

 * Learn scala by porting ocaml.
 * Port type checker from [rhocaml](https://github.com/leithaus/rhocaml),
   which supports reflection but not modal operators.
   * ref _A reflective higher-order calculus_ L.G. Meredith Matthias Radestock
 * Port type checker from [SLMC](http://ctp.di.fct.unl.pt/SLMC/),
   which supports modal operators but not reflection.
